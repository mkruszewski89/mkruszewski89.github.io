I am hard-pressed to find a productive endeavor that could not benefit from technology. This outlook appears to be commonly-held, as technologists relentlessly impose themselves in every industry. Anywhere that has so far resisted the advance is an opportunity.

Before deciding to become a software developer, I owned and operated a cafe and hourly co-working space called Pourt. Pourt was not modelled off any existing establishment, and I was responsible for everything from conception to strategy, operations, financing, marketing...this list goes on. There are myriad "off-the-shelf" software solutions available to the small business owner. Software to sell, software to control inventory, software to manage employees, software to keep books and comply with regulations, software to help cope with all of the software.  

Experience teaches that the world doesn't operate "off-the-shelf". The more in the weeds you get, the longer your wishlist for an ideal solution grows. I have decided to become a software developer to get off the shelf; to empower myself to craft my own solutions for whatever idiosyncratic problem is thrown my way.
